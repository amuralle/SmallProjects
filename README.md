# SmallProjects
Small, untethered projects done either for fun or to learn a particular skill. 

# EnzymeLearner.py
An active learner designed to train a classifier between bacterial and placental strains of alkaline phosphatase (AP). Features include substrate concentration and activity (abs/min)

This small project was inspired by my initial interest in utilizing modAL and scikit learn packages and after performing a biorad protein assay on the two alkaline phosphatases. 

All data from BioRadAssayData.csv was generated in the Carnegie Mellon University Undergraduate Laboratories under Dr. Carrie Doonan and in association with Puja Dutta.
